# ITC Challenges 


## Our Platform
We are currently developing a **web platform** that will serve as the central hub for all our activities. This platform will include:
- **Challenge Repository**: A structured repository containing outputs from our challenges.
- **System Design Repository**: Dedicated section for system architectures, diagrams, and documentation.


## Repository Purpose
This repository will serve as the **official storage space** for all our challenge outputs, system designs, and related resources. It will include:
- Challenge solutions and documentation.
- Code repositories for challenge projects.
- System design files, including architecture diagrams and technical specifications.
